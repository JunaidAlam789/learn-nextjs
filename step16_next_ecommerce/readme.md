Running locally
You will need to use the environment variables defined in .env.example to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use Vercel Environment Variables for this, but a .env file is all that is necessary.

npm i -g vercel
vercel link
vercel env pull  (you can skip it if you have done earlier. there should be only file either .env or .env.local)
pnpm install
pnpm dev

to run locally use:     pnpm i next@13.4.6
to deploy from local to vercel:   pnpm i next@latest


Understand Code From the Repo

Fork the Repo and start creating your own Template

Change UI by using Shadcn UI Components, and improve the UI/UX

You will develop two Templates

1. Using Shadcn UI and Shopify (or some other API)
2. Using Shadcn UI and your own API/Database etc.
